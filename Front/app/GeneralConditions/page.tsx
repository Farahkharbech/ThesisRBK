Thank you for using RentaVilla!
<br/>
These Terms of Service for Tunisian Users are a binding legal agreement between you and RentaVilla that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from RentaVilla (collectively, the “RentaVilla Platform”).
<br/>
 When used in these Terms, “RentaVilla,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the RentaVilla entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.
 <br/>

The RentaVilla Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. 
<br/>
Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.”
<br/>
 Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). 
<br/>

You must register an account to access and use many features of the RentaVilla Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the provider of the RentaVilla Platform, RentaVilla does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services. RentaVilla is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is RentaVilla a real estate broker, travel agency, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive 2015/2302.
<br/>
 RentaVilla is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about RentaVilla’s role see Section 16.
 <br/>

We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the RentaVilla payment entities (collectively "RentaVilla Payments").
<br/>

If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.
